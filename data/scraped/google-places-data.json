They sent lots of updates and pics, as well as a weekly newsletter about what the kids had got up to that week, so I always felt like I knew what was happening.\n\nI also liked how they put on lots of events to help you get to know the teachers and other families, and they put so much effort into helping our daughter (and us!) settle in. It really felt like a little community. We sadly had to leave due to relocating, but otherwise we would have happily kept our daughter here until she went to school - we were very sad to leave! Highly recommend this daycare!",

First and foremost, the teachers are so caring and wonderful - my daughter excitedly tells me about her day everyday and she is so happy to go to school. I really appreciate the videos/photos that RA will post so we can get an update on what goes on during school.  They've also been so accommodating with us and my erratic work schedule (sometimes I need to suddenly pick up early or drop off late, etc. they've been nothing but accommodating). I feel like both my kids truly thrived here through the nurture and care given by the teachers. Secondly, there's a wonderful parent community at RA which has engaged in sharing updates, set up playdates, etc. You can tell not only do the teachers/Jiali care about the students but so do the parents who send their kids here. Third, the mandarin teaching has been exceptional. In fact, sometimes they need to tell ME what a Chinese word means because they've learned so much. My daughter will be graduating to K soon and we'll truly be sad to leave this place. Would highly recommend RA 1000x over",

When we applied for private schools in SF, we got into 5 out of 5 schools we applied to, and I attribute how prepared our kids were for the evaluations due to Richmond Academy. If you want your kids to learn Mandarin, math, manners, and kindness — this is the spot.\n\nWhen we were deciding which kindergarten to attend, we decided not to continue Mandarin immersion because, frankly, our kids would be bored waiting for other kids to catch up.\nYou won’t need to keep switching schools each year; Richmond Academy handles all levels, including daycare, TK, and PK. They let us focus on our careers, knowing our kids were taken care of 8-5pm. Even when we got off work earlier, we would leave them with Jiali, knowing they were happy and thriving at school. Lastly, while many places were closed during Covid, they didn’t let us down and found a way to stay safe and open. We had no learning loss to deal with.\n\nForever grateful for the time our children spent with Richmond Academy!",

Jiali (owner), Jojo (JiaWen), and all the teachers my little one has had over the years have been wonderful. This preschool had everything I wanted: chinese immersion, large open space, food provided, indoor playground, immaculate bathroom, security and convenient drop off location.\n\nI also appreciated that Richmond Academy focused on teaching older children to help younger children, a practice I hoped my little one would learn given they are an only child. Having this ingrained in my little one at school has helped them play well with others, watch out for smaller kids, and also share their toys! Another milestone was potty training. At the beginning of my child's time at Richmond Academy, I brought diapers. However, about a month or so later, I was informed they no longer needed them. I was baffled but so appreciative that they took care of this for me.\n\nAs parents and guardians, it can be hard to choose a preschool. For me, I am grateful I chose Richmond Academy to start off my little one’s education and development. Jiali, her teachers, and staff are very passionate about what they do and I can see they love working with children.",

        "text": "I've had 3 kids attend Richmond Academy and can whole heartily attest to the wonderful program and people here. Jiali (the founder), Jiawan and all teachers are very nurturing and have amazing teaching skills. My kids were constantly singing mandarin songs and reciting poetry at home. I couldn't even get them to recite some of the easiest things I was teaching them in english at home yet they were reading mandarin so confidently. I was so shocked I tested them to make sure it wasn't all memorization. They could really recognize the characters. WOW Parents, they potty train! Need I say more?  They do a super job in this area and the new facility has the best kid's restroom space I've ever seen. A few weeks of potty training was all it took them and I was elated the day they returned my diapers. LOL I must also mention they provide lunch and snacks for the kids. The lunch is nutritious and homemade in house. My kids always spoke positively about the lunch and I very often hear soups and veggies included which made this mama very happy.  I can't express enough how nurturing the teachers are and the safe environment they provide.  All are so warm and lovely that the kids feel secure and excited to go to school.  Hours are very flex, esp for working folks considering they open early and close late. During vacation breaks, the school helps out parents to provide optional school days for an additional fee. This was very convenient vs finding separate care. The first time I toured RA and met Jiali, I knew in my heart of hearts this is where the kids need to go to school. Truth is I forfeited my deposit I placed elsewhere and secured my twins' spot at RA right away. Best decision I made for them. Even if you are touring around, just give RA a chance and I'm confident you'll love the space and school as much as we have. FYI I'm so envious of the play structure Randy, the handy husband built. You'll see all all the dedication and heart they put in the school and kids. RA is a gem and I'm grateful I found this school for my children.",
